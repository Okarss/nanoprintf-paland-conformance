# nanoprintf-paland-conformance
An MIT-licensed copy of the mpaland printf test suite, held separately from nanoprintf to not pollute the public domain license.

This repository really isn't useful by itself; it's an optional submodule for [nanoprintf](https://github.com/charlesnicholson/nanoprintf).
